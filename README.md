# Deep Temporal Transformer for time series forecasting. 

A proposal for a new architecture for time series prediction based on Transformers.

The Transformer architecture, originally introduced for natural language processing tasks, has shown promising results in various domains, including time series prediction. Here's a proposal for a new architecture that leverages the strengths of Transformers for time series forecasting.

⚠️Disclaimer: Optimum select and best combination algorithms may introduce overfitting. If you use it, be sure to implement a system to correct for selection bias, overfitting, and non-normality to ensure model robustness.
This is example code for educational purposes. Under no circumstances put these models into production because the probability of losing money is too high.⚠️
